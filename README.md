# Numbers game
* ```numbers.py``` - implements a Monte-Carlo solver. Run with no parameters, it will randomly select a target, 
                     six numbers (two big), and solve. It accepts parameters for the target, numbers, and maximum 
                     run time. By default, it limits to 30 seconds, the same as the show, and will output the closest 
                     solution found.
